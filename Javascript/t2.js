Karnataka to file review petitions before Supreme Court challenging order to release 3,000 cusecs to Tamil Nadu
After the meeting that lasted nearly two hours, CWMA chairman Saumitra Kumar Haldar told The Hindu from New Delhi that barring Karnataka, 
representatives of other basin States joined the discussion through videoconference. As for Tamil Nadu, the officiating Principal Secretary
 for Water Resources, K. Manivasan, attended the meeting online, while the Cauvery Technical Cellâ€™s chairperson, R. Subramanian, was personally present 
 	in New Delhi.

As in the past, there was an intense exchange of views between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. While the former wanted the continuous release of water 
and demanded 12,500 cusecs, the latter referred to its difficulties in continuing with the supply, apart from pointing out that it was only dependent 
upon the southwest monsoon, which played truant this year, but Tamil Nadu could fall back upon northeast monsoon which would set in during the third or 
fourth week of October.`
