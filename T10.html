            <h1>How COVID-19 changed India’s education system.</h1>
	</div>

      <p>  India’s new education policy focused on centralisation and digitisation to 
        combat the loss of education during the pandemic. Did this really help the students?
        by SHANTHA SINHA <p>
		
       <p> As schools across India shut during the COVID-19 pandemic, the country’s dropout rate 
		more than tripled—from <span> 1.8 percent in 2018 </span> to a staggering 5.3 percent in 2020. This 
		predominantly impacted children hailing from marginalised communities, exacerbating 
		existing inequalities.<p>

     <p>   For children from these communities, schools provide safety and a routine. They ensure
		that children are not pushed into labour. Attending school is also a way for girls to 
		avoid early marriage and ensure mobility and freedom. Additionally, the provision of 
		midday meals by schools serves as a crucial support system in combating child hunger.<p>
